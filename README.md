### Hi ðŸ‘‹
#### Welcome to my Github!

##### I'm Catherine, and I'm currently a freshman @UCI studying Computer Science and Engineering.

#### I'm currently still exploring different fields in CS. So far, I've experimented with robotics programming (C++) and am currently diving into web development. I'm looking forward to learning more about the different specialties in CS and creating different projects!
